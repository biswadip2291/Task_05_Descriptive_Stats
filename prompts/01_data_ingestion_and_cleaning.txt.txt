I have uploaded two CSV files:
1. `game_results_2025.csv`
2. `player_stats_2025.csv`

Please perform the following actions:

1. Load `game_results_2025.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `games_df`.
2. Load `player_stats_2025.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `players_df`.

To verify that the data has been loaded correctly, please display the following for EACH of the two DataFrames:
- The first 5 rows using the `.head()` method.
- A summary of the columns, data types, and non-null values using the `.info()` method.
